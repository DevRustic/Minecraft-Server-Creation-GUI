## FAQ (More to come here)

 Why can't I click on other server buttons?
> Because there is many changes to come within the GUI for making servers! I would have to manually re-import the code from one form, and input them into every other one!

Why isn't my server renaming when I click the Rename button?
> Make sure to click "Reload Server Names" at the top!

Why isn't my Jar file downloading?
> Make sure to check that you have an internet connection! As well as you selected a valid selection in the dropdown!
